# SignSheet
Logs sign ins for [Prairie Aviation Museum](http://prairieaviationmuseum.org/) by having visitors fill in required information and automatically create entries into .csv file without the need to manually parse pieces of paper.

# Running The Application
1. Install [Microsoft .NET 4.7](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55170)
2. Download latest __PAM_SignIn.zip__ from the [releases tab](https://github.com/JacksonWilson/SignSheet/releases)
3. Unzip folder and place anywhere
 
   * Recommended to keep __SignSheet.exe__ in its own folder because it creates the __PAM_SignIn_Export.csv__ file in the same directory

4. Double-click __SignSheet.exe__ to run
5. The __PAM_SignIn_Export.csv__ file can be read with any sheet editor (e.g. Excel, OpenOffice Calc, or Google Sheets)

   * In Excel, if either __Date__ or __Time__ columns show __######__, the column needs to be expanded to fit the whole number
